# Repair Wiki

## Introduction

This repository contains the docker container, software configuration and development tools for the Repair Wiki.

## Development usage

### Required software
- Docker
- make

For Windows users we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### Initial setup
1. Clone submodules
    ```sh
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```
2. Configure a .env file (see .env.example for reference).
3. Start the development instance
    ```sh
    make run
    ```
4. Initiate the database
    ```sh
    make init
    ```
5. Run the update script (initialise all other tables)
    ```sh
    make update
    ```
6. Build the search index
    ```sh
    make cirrus-config
    make cirrus-reindex
    ```

### Manual update
MediaWiki requires you to run an update script occasionally (with changes to extensions or other database updates).

You can run this maintenance script manually by running the following command:
```sh
make update
```

### Manually running the job-queue
MediaWiki uses a job-queue based system for specific maintenance tasks, this command is automatically run inside the container by a cron-job. However you can manually run the maintenance script by running the following command:
```sh
make run-jobs
```
